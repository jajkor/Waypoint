# Waypoint
Thomas McLinden, Rob Jajko, Sarim Kazmi, Adam Jeffery Zorgo
# Team Report:
- Last week: Finalize decisions to begin production on the prototype.
- This week: Thomas attempted to create the first 2D indoor navigation prototype of the Sutherland Building's first floor using IndoorAtlas, with some progress. However, Rob would take over this role as Thomas created a model of Rydal Executive Plaza's third floor to test Rob's implementation. Sarim has began working on the application's UI.
- Next week: Each team member will continue production on their respective parts of the project.
- # Contributions of individual team members:
- Thomas: This week, I used IndoorAtlas in hopes of using their service to aid in the creation of our indoor navigation software. I had achieved some level of success, but haven't been able to implement their map into our Android application. Rob has since taken over this role. I plan to help Sarim with his role and continue creating the 3D models for the application, like I have with the Rydal Plaza thus far.
- Rob: This week I refactored a alot of the rendering code, I modified the ModelLoader to store and load model information from mtl files. I also cleaned up the model drawing code to be more general. Finally, I began looking into the various ways we could do indoor location tracking.
- Sarim: This week, my primary focus has been debugging the main activity. I have faced challenges with running Android Studio smoothly, so I am progressing by working through the code one file at a time. I have a basic UI ready, just need to implement the backend.
- Adam: (no submission)
