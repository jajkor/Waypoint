Adam will continue to work on the UI by adding the functions to current existing visual assets.
- Last Week: Thomas intends to have a working UI for the 3D map view, Rob will continue researching and developing the indoor 3D tracking, and Sarim will continue UI and database development.
- This week: This week, Thomas created the app's logo and worked on UI elements. Rob continued development on the real-time tracking and main functions of the app. Sarim continued development on connecting the database with the UI and implementing the app logo.

# Contributions of individual team members:
- Thomas (11/6): This week, I have made the app's icon and begun development on the map UI by experimenting with Claude. I am close to having a working prototype, with drop down menus to select a room for pathfinding and the floors of the building.
- Thomas (11/13): This week, I created the map Viewer UI. It contains a text label to indicate the building name, a back button to return to the map selection screen, a drop down menu to select a floor, and a toggle button to switch between the 2D and 3D view. My plan to next week is to be able to work with Sarim to implement their functionalities.
- Rob (11/6): This week I developed an android app to scan the RSSI of nearby APs using their BSSID. After further testing I hope to use this concept and app in the future. Also, I worked on our CI workflow as well as instrumentation and unit tests for the main app.
- Rob (11/13): This week, I setup a third wifi ap to test the RSSI demo app at home. I then continued working on the functionality that will later be used for waypoint.
- Sarim (11/6): This week, I continued working on the UI for our app, focusing on the main activity. I researched how to connect the database with the UI. I also explored different ideas for adding a logo for the app and how to implement it.
- Sarim (11/13): I continued development on the main activity for the application and researching Database connectivity.
- Adam (11/14):  I was looking at ways to connect the UI to the database.
