# Team Report:
- Last week: The main goal is to ensure that the foundation for the project is complete, with all roles being assigned to each person on our team. Production will begin soon after. Each role should be assigned by September 18th.
- This week, each team member has obtained and familiarized themselves with the tools necessary to develop this application. Thomas and Sarim familiared themselves with Android Studio and Rob created the Github for the application and acquired the necessary files from Abington Township to create the 3D model of the Woodland building.
- The goals for next week is to begin the implementation stage of development. This can include modeling the Woodland building or beginning the first stages of coding.
# Contributions of individual team members:
- Thomas: Thus far, I have installed Android Studio and the Gemini plugin to assist with debugging. Multiple 3D modeling softwares have been tested to export OBJ files to be used in our project. The only issue I have encounted was during testing with Blender. As of the making of this report, I am still experimenting with camera controls, applying textures, and contorting models. My plan for the following week is to make final decisions on what softwares will be used for my role in the project and begin the first stages of planning. I will consult with my team members and ensure we all agree before proceeding to the beginning stages of development.
- Rob: So far, I reached out to the Township of Abington and received a response in the form of a zip file containing much of the public records about the campus. I went through the PDF files and picked out those that could be used to create our 3D representation of the school. I also finished setting up the Github repository for the project and wrote up a README file. Finally, I began doing research into Android app structure by looking at the docs and other examples on Github.
- Sarim: This week, I focused on installing Android Studio and Gemini, and getting familiarized with the software with the aid of Youtube and the Android Developers website.  After familiarizing myself with the user interface and features of both tools, I took time to learn Kotlin through various YouTube tutorials. Looking ahead, my next steps include scheduling a meeting with my team to align on project goals and starting hands-on practice with the platform we'll be using for the remainder of the project. Overall, this week has laid a solid foundation for my upcoming work.
- Adam: (No submission)
