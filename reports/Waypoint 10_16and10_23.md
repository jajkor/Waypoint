# Team Report:
- Last week: Testing for the application will begin. The model will be imported into Android Studio and we will begin researching real-time location tracking.
- This week: Thomas created yet another 3D model of the Sutherland Building and experimented with Android SDK 2.0 in hopes of creating an working demo. Rob continued with importing models and experimenting with rendering styles. Sarim begun production on the database for the project.
- Next week: Finalize decisions to begin production on the prototype.
- # Contributions of individual team members:
- Thomas, 10/16: This week, a model of the Sutherland Building's first floor has been created. My next step is to have a working beta application, where the user can walk through the first floor of the Sutherland building. Once complete, the remaining floors will be created.
- Thomas, 10/23: I have experimented with Android SDK 2.0 alongside Rob in the hopes of having a working demo for our application. I haven't been successful yet, but I haven't exhausted every option. By the end of this week, I should have finalized my decisions on our next steps. 
- Rob, 10/16: This week I continued reading up on Android Studio and  importing a completed model of the 1st floor of the Sutherland building into the app.
- -Rob, 10/23: This week I noticed that the shading on the model looked off, after trying different solutions I opted to use the javagl obj file loader off github.
- Sarim, 10/16: I have developed a relational model that outlines the key attributes and relationships necessary for the functionality of our project. To clarify the project's design, I created a UML diagram that serves as an outline for the group.
- Sarim, 10/23: This week I integrated database connectivity into the main activity screen, implementing a full campus management system with CRUD operations. I created a CampusService to handle database interactions, allowing users to view, search, and manage campus entries  from the main interface.
