# Team Report:
- Last week: The goals for next week is to begin the implementation stage of development. This can include modeling the Woodland building or beginning the first stages of coding.
- This week: The groundwork for the project has been set as the first stages of development have begun. Thomas created the first 3D model for the application, to which Rob has imported into Android Studio for testing. Sarim has created a relational model to aid in the creation of the project.
- Next week: Testing for the application will begin. The model will be imported into Android Studio and we will begin researching real-time location tracking.
# Contributions of individual team members:
- Thomas: This week, a model of the Sutherland Building's first floor has been created. My next step is to have a working beta application, where the user can walk through the first floor of the Sutherland building. Once complete, the remaining floors will be created.
- Rob: This week I continued reading up on Android Studio and  importing a completed model of the 1st floor of the Sutherland building into the app.
- Sarim: I have developed a relational model that outlines the key attributes and relationships necessary for the functionality of our project. To clarify the project's design, I created a UML diagram that serves as an outline for the group.
- Adam: (No submission)
